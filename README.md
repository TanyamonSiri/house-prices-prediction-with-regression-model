## Project Day: Real Estate Price Prediction 🏠🏘️🪴
This notebook is a part of a final project in **The Data Master** program by xLab Digital.


### Description

The goal of this report is to highlight:
As this is the final project, I will focus on
- Explore multiple feature engineering methods
- Apply scikit-learn Pipeline to create pipeline for preprocessing and column transformer
- Implement linear regression model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset

### Dataset Acknowledgements
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. 
It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
